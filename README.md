# RedditDailyChallenges
This project will hold some of the solutions to the Reddit Daily Challenges, which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer. (Note this will not work at school without an admin password)

Anyone who is a member of DCHS Programming Club can commit and send pull requests, but there is a very important naming convention to be followed so that we can keep track of who did what.

For file names, always name like the following: lastname_redditDate_shortTitle. lastName is self explanatory, and don't be like Andrei otherwise I will delete your file. redditDate was the date this was posted on Reddit, for example 8-5-2015 (make sure you use dashes here and not underscores). shortTitle is the name given by the Reddit admins, like Connect Four or Palindromes or whatever. 

This convention is really important so please adhere to it. As I mentioned earlier, if someone is not following this convention, I will warn you first, but after a second offense it will be deleted. Real programmers have to know what each file does, and it isn't helpful if you name a sorter class "floweryUnicorn" or something else that is off topic. Hopefully you all like these problems and don't feel discouraged if you can't solve one because some of them are genuinely difficult. 

As always, feel free to contact me (Manu Singhal) if you have any questions.
